	<p> On September 7, 2018, Mac Miller was found unconscious at his home in Los Angeles. The rapper was announced dead at the scene from an apparent drug overdose at 26 years old. Following his death, tributes to Mac dominated social media. The enormous outpouring of sadness, love, and support from his fans and fellow musicians was a tough pill to swallow. Soon after, his family launched the Mac Miller Circles Fund with a goal to help young people in underserved communities, later announcing A Celebration of Life: a benefit concert featuring tributes from Travis Scott, Action Bronson, and SZA.</p>
  <p> “My favorite thing about life right now is that I can go to sleep. I lay my head on the pillow like, 'I did good today,” said Mac, two years before his death. His legacy is one unlike any other; the people who knew him personally understood his spirit and his fervor of a better tomorrow. Let’s all try to do good, everyday.</p>
