		<p>Mac Miller discovered his affinity for rapping after freestyling over a beat during a smoke session with friends at just 14 years old. From that point on, Mac dedicated his life and career to hip-hop, creating the moniker Mac Miller in 2009, under which he released two mixtapes: The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown and The High Life. The two projects established Miller as an undeniable talent in his hometown of Pittsburgh; he was named the 21 & Under of the Year at the 2010 Pittsburg Hip Hop Awards and won Best Hip-Hop Video for the track “Live Free,” which depicts a grayscale Manhattan wherein teenage Mac Miller explores the city in a snapback and a pair of Apple headphones.</p>
