	<p> In 2014, Miller dropped Faces. His next two records, GO:OD AM and The Divine Feminine, were released under REMember Music in partnership with Warner Bros. Music. Both projects boasted features from his peers, including Anderson .Paak, Kendrick Lamar, and Ab-Soul. Swimming is the last album Mac Miller released before his death in 2018. The project chronicled the rapper’s struggle towards self-acceptance, and it was posthumously nominated for Best Rap Album at the Grammy Awards. “Self Care,” the standout track on the album, was certified gold, and was accompanied by a music video wherein Mac Miller escapes a coffin after being buried alive. It was released just two months before his death.</p>
