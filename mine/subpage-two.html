	<p>In preparation for his next album, Watching Movies with the Sound Off, Miller starred in his own MTV2 reality show, Mac Miller and the Most Dope Family, which gave fans an inside look on what it’s like to be the hottest white rapper in the game. Before the project was released, Mac dropped another mixtape and featured on multiple songs. Run On Sentences Vol. 1, Miller’s ninth mixtape, showed off his instrumental skills without vocals under his now-infamous moniker, Larry Fisherman. After he dropped ROS, Miller was featured on “The Way,” a single by Ariana Grande, which is presumably where the stars seeded the beginnings of their relationship. Watching Movies with the Sound Off spawned three singles, “S.D.S.,” “Watching Movies,” and “Goosebumpz,” and a myriad of features.</p>
